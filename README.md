Sbout:

The objective of this project was to create a digital portfolio to promote my path as a developer. 

The digital portfolio includes a profile picture, animated GIF header and various features such as working styled links, 
an input field, links to previous work and a custom footer.

The page shows a section with three main pieces - an 'about me', a GitHub section displaying current work, and a contact info portion. 

At the bottom, a custom footer has been added.

The deployed page can be found here: https://karguello90.github.io/Arguello-Creations-Digital-Portfolio/
